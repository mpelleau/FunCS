# Enigma N-queens

The [N-queens Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a wellknown puzzle in combinatorics. The goal is to put ![https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=n](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n) non-attacking queens on a ![https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=n\times&space;n](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n\times&space;n) checkerboard. A queen can attack another if they are on the same row, same column or the same diagonals.

## Material
  - Printer and paper
  - Plastic Laminator and Plastic Sheet

## DIY
  1. Print the chessboard and the queens make sure to apply the same scale factor
  2. Print the clues from 1 to 3
  3. Print the clue 4, make sure to print the map with actual size or to apply the same scale factor to the princess path and the map
  4. Print the princess path on a transparent sheet
  5. Print both sides of the statement on the same piece of paper
  6. Cut it and/or burn the edges
  7. Using the plastic sheets, laminate the different printed materials
  8. Cut the queens
  
## Enigma description
  1. Hide the clues, some can be put in books, other on the wall
  2. The clues give you the position of 4 queens
  3. The 4 remaining queens give you the lock combinaison
  4. Depending on the chosen difficulty, finding the 4 remaining queens is more or less easy
  5. For both difficulties, the combinaison is the same, in our example the combinaison is 8 4 2 3, but by just changing the letters order on the statement, you can change the combinaison

## Sources
  - the [chessboard](./common/checkerboard8x8.pdf), by printing it to actual size it should give you a 1m50 x 1m50 chessboard
  - the [queens](./common/queens.pdf), 4 of each color so that the participants can differentiate the queens found by a clue and those that find by them, we did not use these queens instead we bought 30cm height queen
  - the [statement front](./common/consigne_recto.pdf) for the enigma and depending on the difficulty use the [easy](./easy/consigne_verso_easy.pdf) or the [less easy](./less_easy/consigne_verso_less_easy.pdf) back giving the columns order
  - the [first clue](./common/indice1.pdf) giving the position of a queen
  - the [second clue](./common/indice2.pdf) and [an illustration](./common/indice2bis.pdf) giving the rules of attacking with a queen
  - the third clue in [easy](./easy/indice3_easy.pdf) or [less easy](./less_easy/indice3_less_easy.pdf), giving the postition a queen by showing which cells the queen attacks
  - the fourth clue, composed of a [map](./common/indice4.pdf), a [story](./common/indice4bis.pdf) and a princess path for the [easy](./easy/indice4_easy.pdf) or [less easy](./less_easy/indice4_less_easy.pdf) difficulty
