# Enigma Coloring

The [Graph Coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) is a wellknown problem in graph theory. The problem is to color the vertices of a graph so that adjacent vertices to not have the same color.

**For the moment the material is only in french!**

## Material
  - Printer and paper
  - Plastic Laminator and Plastic Sheet

## DIY
  1. Print the clue
  2. Print the graph
  3. Print the colors on a transparent sheet using the same scale factor as the graph
  4. Print both sides of the statement on the same piece of paper
  5. Cut it and/or burn the edges
  6. Using the plastic sheets, laminate the different printed materials
  
## Enigma description
  1. Hide the clues, some can be put in books, other on the wall
  2. The clues give you the rules of the problem
  3. The 4 vertices with the same color give you the lock combinaison
  4. For both difficulties, the combinaison is the same, in our example the combinaison is 5 0 9 4, but by just changing the numbers in the vertices, you can change the combinaison
